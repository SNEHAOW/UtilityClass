# Utility Project

## Objective

The Utility project is a Java application designed to provide various utility methods for working with lists. It includes functionalities such as linear search, merging lists, checking if one list contains another, and removing multiples of 10 from a list. The project serves as a practical exercise in implementing generic classes and methods while ensuring code reusability and flexibility.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing generic classes and methods to work with different data types
- Writing test cases using JUnit to ensure the correctness of utility methods
- Understanding and applying concepts such as linear search, list merging, and containment checks
- Handling different types of lists and performing operations based on their contents

### Tools Used

- **Java**: The project is implemented in Java, a widely-used programming language known for its platform independence and versatility.
- **JUnit**: Test cases are written using JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java.
- **GitHub**: The code is hosted on GitHub, enabling version control, collaboration, and project showcase.

## Steps

1. **Linear Search**: The `linearSearch` method searches for a specified element in the list and returns its index if found, otherwise returns -1.

2. **Merge Lists**: The `mergeList` method merges the current list with another list passed as a parameter.

3. **Check List Containment**: The `containList` method checks if the current list contains all elements of another list.

4. **Remove Multiples of 10**: The `removeMultipleOf10` method removes all elements from the list that are multiples of 10.

## Getting Started

To use the Utility project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `UtilityTest` class to execute the test cases and ensure the functionality of utility methods.
4. Explore the `Utility` class to understand its methods and how they can be used in your Java projects.
